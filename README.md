# Discord-Fun
Weird Discord Self-botting Tools I Thought Were Funny.

I'll add some more tools when I get bored but for right now there's only two.

# The Tools

## Spam Bot
Your average spam bot which takes input of message, token, frequency, and Channel ID to spam messages in a chat.

## Typing Bot
Example: "**Drowzee** is typing..." 

Takes input of token and Channel ID to send a request to the Discord API which makes the typing message appear while the bot is running.

## Future
I'll add more scripts and stuff when I feel like I want to. Feel free to commit to the project if you want a tool added!
